Basics datasets are available via direct URLs, for example:
`pl.read_parquet("https://github.com/radiant-ai-hub/pyrsm/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/data/basics/salary.parquet")`.

- salary -> salary_description.md
- consider -> consider_description.md
- demand_uk -> demand_uk_description.md
- newspaper -> newspaper_description.md

Each `*_description.md` file sits alongside the parquet source to help LLMs/tools
surface context about the variables.
